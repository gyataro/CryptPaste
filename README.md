# CryptPaste
> CryptPaste is a pastebin clone made with MongoDB, Express, Svelte, and Node.

Security: uploaded content can be optionally encrypted, the server will have no knowledge of the pasted data. Users can encrypt the pasted data with a single password, or a distributed secret share via Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing.

Privacy: users can set an expiry time, toggle visibility settings, and toggle burn after reading on the pastes.
