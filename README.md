# CryptPaste
## Introduction
CryptPaste is a pastebin clone where uploaded content is encrypted, the server has no knowledge of the pasted data. Users can encrypt the pasted data with a single password, or a distributed secret share via Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing.

This project is inspired by the two-man rule in nuclear submarines, in which launching nuclear missiles requires the presence of two or more authorized people at the same time.
